Assignment A5

The final executable was compiled on this machine:
gl11

How to invoke my program:
./rt [options] [scene-file]

Where the options are described in the program manual and scene-file is a LUA
scene script. It scene-file is unspecified, scene.lua is used.

No assumptions were made beyond the user specifying reasonable values for
program options (see the manual for more information).

Also: to run the test files under the data/ directory, you must run 'source
.setup' from the data/ directory. This adds the data/include/ directory to your
LUA include path and aliases my binary to the 'rt' command. It may not work if
you use a shell other than the bash shell.

Data files:

I prepared several data files other than screenshot01.png for use in my demo.
These are the PNG files at data/demos/*.png.

My demo webpage itself is under data/docs/demo.html, if you wish to view it.
