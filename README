Assignment A5

The final executable was compiled on this machine:
gl14

How to invoke my program:
./rt [options] [scene-file]

Where the options are described in the program manual and scene-file is a LUA
scene script. It scene-file is unspecified, scene.lua is used.

No assumptions were made beyond the user specifying reasonable values for
program options (see the manual for more information).

Also: to run the test files under the data/ directory, you must run 'source
.setup' from the data/ directory. This adds the data/include/ directory to your
LUA include path and aliases my binary to the 'rt' command. It may not work if
you use a shell other than the bash shell.

Data files:

I prepared several data files other than screenshot01.png for use in my demo.
These are the PNG files at data/demos/*.png.

My demo webpage itself is at cs488/handin/A5_docs/demo.html, if you wish to view it.

My objectives:
 
1. Cylinder and cone primitives have been added.

2. Texture mapping works for all primitives. Textures are loaded from png files.

3. Bump mapping works. Bump maps can be specified via png files (in the same manner
as textures), but there is at least one procedurally defined mapping.

4. Reflection has been accomplished.

5. Refraction and transparency have been accomplished.

6. Soft shadows have been accomplished.

7. Constructive solid geometry has been accomplished.

8. Caustic effects have been accomplished via photon mapping.

9. Projection maps have been used to improve the efficiency of forward ray tracing for caustics.

10. My laboratory final scene has been modelled and rendered.
