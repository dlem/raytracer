Comments

--Bug in CSG union function, second child ends, may not want interface.
--What is the deal with refl_attn...?
--outgoing.dot(ph.outgoing) computation in photon map
Fix gi? Meh.

Improve some of the demos
--Better projection map demo
--Timings to implementation
Acknowledgements and get rid of url in README
Try increasing # photons in prm2
